## ‚ùì FAQ

### Do I need an Azure subscription?
**No!** Microsoft provides FREE temporary storage as part of your M365 subscription. You do NOT need a paid Azure account.

### Why is the Delete permission missing?
This is **intentional**. Microsoft's temporary storage excludes delete permission to prevent accidental file deletions. This is normal and expected.

### Can I use this with Exchange on-premises?
No, this tool is designed for **Microsoft 365 cloud mailboxes** only. For on-premises Exchange, use other import methods.

### How long does the SAS URL last?
Typically 30-90 days. The tool will warn you when it's about to expire.

### Where are my logs?
```
C:\Users\<YourUsername>\Documents\PSTImportTool\Logs\
```

### The upload is slow. Is this normal?
Yes, upload speeds depend on:
- Your internet connection
- PST file size
- Azure data center location
- Network congestion

Large PST files (>10 GB) can take several hours.

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### "SAS URL validation failed"
- Check that you copied the complete URL (it's very long!)
- Ensure the URL hasn't expired
- Verify you generated it from Purview (not Azure Portal)

### "Missing permissions"
- Verify you have eDiscovery Manager role in Purview
- Check Exchange permissions (Organization Management or Compliance Management)
- Wait 15-30 minutes for role propagation
- Sign out and back into Microsoft 365

### Application won't start
- Check Windows Event Viewer for errors
- Ensure .NET Framework 4.7.2+ is installed
- Try running as Administrator
- Reinstall the application

### Upload fails or stalls
- Check your internet connection
- Verify SAS URL hasn't expired
- Check firewall/proxy settings
- Review application logs for detailed errors
