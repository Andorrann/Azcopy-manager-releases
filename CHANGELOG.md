## Version 1.1.0

**Release Date**: 2025-10-03

### ‚ú® New Features
- **Automatic Update Checker**: Application now checks for updates on startup and notifies users when a new version is available

- **Modern Permissions Guide**: Interactive modal dialog with step-by-step setup instructions and direct links to Microsoft portals
- **Unlock PST Selection**: Users can now unlock and change PST selections after locking them for configuration

### üêõ Bug Fixes
- **Fixed SAS Permission Detection**: Correctly identifies Azure Blob permissions (Write, Add, Create, List) instead of incorrectly checking for Read
- **Removed Delete Functionality**: Removed "Remove" button and delete permission checks (not available on Microsoft's temporary storage)
- **Fixed Application Crash**: Resolved crashes occurring after locking PST files for configuration
- **Corrected Permission Requirements**: Updated guide to reflect that Microsoft provides free temporary storage (no paid Azure subscription needed)

### üîß Improvements
- **Simplified Lock Workflow**: Removed confirmation modal when locking PST selections for smoother user experience
- **Better Permission Display**: Explicit permission names (Read, Write, List, Delete) instead of cryptic abbreviations (r, w, l, d)
- **Color-Coded Status**: Green for complete, Orange for warnings (e.g., missing optional Delete permission), Red for critical errors
- **Centered UI Elements**: All permission status labels are now centered with modern Segoe UI font
- **PST Size Display**: Shows PST file sizes in GB for easier understanding
- **Tooltips Instead of Modals**: Replaced aggressive information popups with helpful tooltips on info icons
- **Improved Logging**: Enhanced logging for mapping events and PST locking operations

### üé® UI/UX Enhancements
- **Modernized Setup Tab**: Redesigned SAS URL input with better styling and layout
- **"Found X PSTs" Message**: Moved next to "Load PST" button with modern font (green for found, red for none)
- **Centered SAS Status**: "SAS URL is valid" message now centered below input field
- **Reduced Button Heights**: Adjusted "Lock Selection & Configure" and "Remove" button sizes for better visual balance
- **Blue Highlight for Locked PSTs**: Multiple locked PSTs now correctly highlighted in blue
- **Smaller PST Tree**: Adjusted height to prevent overlap with buttons

### üìö Documentation
- **Complete Permissions Guide**: Comprehensive markdown guide (`PERMISSIONS_GUIDE.md`) with:
  - Azure Blob Storage SAS URL generation instructions
  - Microsoft Purview eDiscovery Manager role assignment
  - Exchange Online permission configuration
  - Troubleshooting common permission issues
  - PowerShell commands for verification
  - Security best practices

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes
- **SAS URL Permissions**: Microsoft's temporary storage only provides Write/Add/List permissions. Delete permission is intentionally excluded to prevent accidental deletions.
- **No Azure Subscription Needed**: Application works with Microsoft's free temporary storage provided as part of M365 subscription.
